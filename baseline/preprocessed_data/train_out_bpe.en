Tom has been de@@ ta@@ ined by the police .
your name is fa@@ mili@@ ar to me .
it is compu@@ ted at 1@@ 0@@ ,000 yen .
today I have a lot of things to do .
I studied for a year in Boston .
it doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
he doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears !
should I open the windows ?
during my last spring vacation I took a job in a restaurant to help pay the costs of my trip abroad .
and , they &apos;ve already tor@@ n up the garden .
they make toys at this factory .
she almost got away with it .
I already told you .
the lady wearing sunglasses seemed very strange .
where &apos;s the beach ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the b@@ ass guitar .
she sp@@ read honey th@@ ickly on her to@@ ast .
do you spend more time with your friends or with your family ?
no one who is a decent human being could possibly support this project .
first of all , power off your c@@ ell@@ ph@@ ones and rema@@ in silent .
he decided that if God didn &apos;t exist then everything was per@@ mitted .
get rid of her .
swimming regularly is good for your health .
the woman sleep@@ s in the bed@@ room .
open the door !
does Tom have a hunting license ?
where was Tom working then ?
he is no longer a boy .
that &apos;s quite meaningless .
Tom isn &apos;t a very nice guy .
you are not at all what I expected .
that wasn &apos;t such a bad idea .
will you be doing that again ?
Tom seems un@@ sure .
too good to be true .
I remember both of you .
he gave up going abroad to study because of his father &apos;s sudden death .
he sh@@ ined his shoes .
how much is the mon@@ thly rate ?
we took advantage of the fine weather to play tennis .
we could sure do with some rain .
aren &apos;t you going to sing ?
then you just have to fill out this card .
Tom told me what happened .
there was not a cl@@ oud in the sky .
I can &apos;t raise our child by myself .
they &apos;re not afraid of hard work .
this time , you &apos;ve crossed the line !
you should try to make the most of your opportun@@ ities .
did anyone see you come in ?
Tom can no longer live here .
Tom died of li@@ ver cancer .
it app@@ ears to me you &apos;re mista@@ ken .
are you a tre@@ k@@ ki@@ e ?
the pro@@ j@@ ector doesn &apos;t work .
I ju@@ dged you too quickly .
the Russi@@ ans are on our side .
dry wood bur@@ ns well .
Tom was offered a leading ro@@ le in a hor@@ ror movie .
there &apos;s no one by that name here .
Mary kept chec@@ king her watch .
you must start soon .
it &apos;s snowing there .
in contra@@ st to yesterday , it isn &apos;t hot at all today .
it happened so fast .
I need to speak with you right away .
I held my breath and waited .
I don &apos;t have time for nonsense .
what &apos;s your favorite thing to do in your free time ?
what time does the store open ?
I know that it is high@@ ly un@@ likely that we &apos;ll see any wh@@ al@@ es today .
this is a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are .
today pil@@ ot f@@ ati@@ gue seems more likely .
the best way to catch a train on time is to make sure to miss the one that pre@@ ce@@ des it .
there &apos;s no need to be afraid .
the storm let up .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
the person who wants nothing , hopes for nothing , and f@@ ears nothing can never be an artist .
he has red hair and f@@ rec@@ k@@ les .
you &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t believe his good fortun@@ e .
Tom found Mary &apos;s diary .
we had breakfast .
Tom is a fast eater .
Tom is good , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve no proof to the con@@ tr@@ ary .
the wicked w@@ it@@ ch pu@@ shed her into the deep water .
Tom slept in his office .
Tom was going to lie , but he ended up sp@@ illing the be@@ ans .
stay close .
it &apos;s like bed@@ la@@ m in here .
she has wat@@ ered the plants .
Tom fa@@ ked his death .
open the door !
see you next week !
it is car@@ eless of you to say such things .
I &apos;ll put some salt on the meat .
Mary told John the secret .
he says we should go that way .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was thirsty .
there were some students in the classroom .
I &apos;d like to help you .
tell him where he should go .
you should never ask a woman how old she is .
no one expected her to win .
the squirrel is the guardian spir@@ it of our tri@@ be .
the P@@ an@@ the@@ on is now a ch@@ urch .
I apologize for what &apos;s happened here .

let &apos;s check the map .
can you put up with the noise ?
he has a P@@ ic@@ as@@ so .
we &apos;ll go by bus unless E@@ l@@ en@@ a wants to take a taxi .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t walk any longer .
it &apos;s well worth it .
he d@@ ried his swea@@ ty fore@@ head .
Tom slept on the cou@@ ch .
you &apos;d better not go there again .
I &apos;m watching .
Tom has a daughter named Mary .
I would give it to them .
have you ever been stuck in an elevator ?
don &apos;t forget to change the cat li@@ tter .
I think that &apos;s a lot of ho@@ g@@ wash .
Tom is a car me@@ chan@@ ic .
Tom is good at chess , too .
I already said no .
it wasn &apos;t worth as much as they were char@@ ging for it .
didn &apos;t you miss anything ?
she really got on my ner@@ ves .
we ate a ha@@ sty mea@@ l and left immediately .
did Pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i intelligence really know nothing about the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist &apos;s wh@@ er@@ ea@@ b@@ ou@@ ts ?
he slammed his door shut .
are you saying this doesn &apos;t matter ?
let me put this differ@@ ently .
we celebr@@ ated our tenth wedding an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary yesterday .
who wants to kill you ?
just between us , he &apos;s not a deep thin@@ ker .
the fact cannot be den@@ i@@ ed .
put your toys away .
a lot of bic@@ y@@ cles are il@@ le@@ g@@ ally parked in front of the station .
Tom is s@@ having .
her youngest child is five years old .
how could you do that ?
she has a mag@@ ne@@ tic person@@ ality .
Tom seems in@@ sin@@ c@@ ere .
it &apos;s as if Tom and Mary were made for each other .
they don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
I feel like a drink .
I can no longer stand this noise .
I &apos;m holding in my hands a book by S@@ us@@ an@@ n@@ a T@@ a@@ mar@@ o .
if I were you , I would wait and see .
she &apos;s nuts .
in D@@ en@@ mark , there aren &apos;t any yellow post@@ bo@@ x@@ es .
Tom wants to say hello .
we &apos;re not desperate yet .
have you got 5@@ ,000 yen you could lend me ?
what are you going to do to me ?
should I close the door ?
Unfortunately , I never got the chance to meet her .
we fight all the time .
he &apos;s smart .
don &apos;t tell Tom anything .
the answer mis@@ ses the point .
he offered to help me .
if you would like to have fur@@ ther information , please cont@@ act me .
watch us .
if I had known it , I would have told it to you .
a ca@@ b is waiting .
you will not speak to me like that .
Tom was sitting in the dark , smoking a cigarett@@ e .
he doesn &apos;t show any sign of life .
could you give us a minute ?
ro@@ ck , paper , s@@ cis@@ sors .
do you have a website ?
can we at least think about it for a minute ?
I think you &apos;re the most beautiful girl I &apos;ve ever seen .
even though the train was late , we made it in time .
he knows how to fly a h@@ eli@@ co@@ p@@ ter .
you re@@ mind me of my son .
I read this book when I was in college .
Tom loved bananas .
a pencil is stic@@ king out of your pocket .
if only I were such a beautiful and talented person .
I think it must &apos;ve been Tom who sent Mary that note .
the heat was un@@ bear@@ able .
I have to get up quite early tomorrow .
it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
I ask about apples , and you answer me about p@@ ears .
newsp@@ apers lay s@@ cat@@ ter@@ ed all over the floor .
at that time , white bread and meat were considered a lu@@ x@@ ury .
the family loves to watch murder myst@@ er@@ ies together .
we were crazy about each other .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .

Mary is see@@ king a job .
he threw the book in the fire .
Tom started doing squ@@ at th@@ ru@@ sts in the waiting room .
come to my house whenever you like .
he threw the letter into the fire .
I always give something to the beg@@ gar@@ s .
if you like , I &apos;ll tell you about what happened to Tom .
this stat@@ ue belongs to us .
please do not think of a pink elephant right now .
please don &apos;t make me help Tom .

he can &apos;t be under thirty .
I don &apos;t want that one .
do you drink wine ?
do Tom and Mary have learning dis@@ abi@@ li@@ ties ?
she might not know that we are here .
she has a bottle of milk every morning .
I don &apos;t need that kind of stress in my life .
she must be mad at me .

Tom &apos;s house is completely destroyed .
we know you &apos;re in here .
Tom lived a simple life .
she &apos;s worrying for your sa@@ fe@@ ty .
we like children .
Tom lived there for many years .
Y@@ o , check this out .
Tom is just trying to s@@ care you .
may I ask you a personal question ?
would you really do that for me ?

I love spending time with her .

Tom still rememb@@ ers you .
America is a country on the move .
Tom thinks his country is the greatest country in the world .

if you understand , please raise your hand .
I had to decl@@ ine his offer .

she &apos;s my older sister .
he sup@@ por@@ ted himself with a stick .
maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
I will only buy the car if they repair the bra@@ kes first .
if it were not for the sun , we would all die .
all you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday .
the small se@@ ed became a large tree .
does anybody else know about this ?
Tom asked Mary for John &apos;s telephone number .
you can be such a dra@@ ma qu@@ een , Tom .
we know how Tom is .
shouldn &apos;t we be doing something to help Tom ?
the old man served the king for many years .
everything that Tom said is true .
take what you like .
Tom seemed to have reco@@ vered .
Tom is irre@@ si@@ sti@@ ble .
I went out in spite of the rain .
there are sentences whose translation into certain languages is sen@@ seless and , ther@@ e@@ fore , should be avoided .
she confessed her love to him .
I &apos;m so tired !
Tom whispered something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
I imagine that Tom will eventually run out of money and have to go back home .
she is drawing a picture .
how long do you think Tom will work for us before he qu@@ its and goes to another company ?
in Brit@@ ain the Me@@ tr@@ o is known as the Un@@ der@@ ground , not as the sub@@ way .

Tom said that he was angry .
you &apos;re probably as very talented as I am !
I &apos;d like to buy a map .
he did nothing wrong .
you can &apos;t escape .
that was a fun conversation .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
it was used only from time to time .
the manager deals with many problems .
during summer brea@@ ks , I ate dinner at midnight .
Tom was there for three hours .
please do that some@@ time today .
the traffic ban@@ ked up for several kilo@@ me@@ tre@@ s because two lan@@ es were closed for ro@@ ad@@ works .
I don &apos;t remember inv@@ iting you here .
I was surprised Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
each of us needs to fully explo@@ it his pot@@ ential .
just follow them .
it is very rude of you to expect me to eat food that I do not want to .
I bought a new handbag .
she re@@ sen@@ ted being called a co@@ ward .
but he is still alive ?
this telephone is out of order .
no doubt he will pass the examination .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
I &apos;m not sure Tom is willing to help us .
it &apos;s na@@ ive of you to believe that .
she rejected him .
I usually get up at 7 : 00 .
show me the photos , please .
sweet dreams !
do you know if Tom is here ?
I have to do that before Tom and Mary get here .
I think Tom and Mary are still home@@ sick .

he let her kiss him .
you can do whatever you want to , of course .
tears were ro@@ l@@ ling down her chee@@ k .
some animals eat their young .
there are three pri@@ m@@ ary col@@ ours .
we shouldn &apos;t have done this .
she isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom speaks excellent Russian , but his German is ab@@ y@@ s@@ mal .
&quot; why is your room pink , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
he is not really a friend , just an ac@@ qua@@ int@@ ance .
do you anno@@ y your brothers ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I saw a man knocked down by a car .
there &apos;s not enough coffee .
he &apos;s in a good mood today .
let me know when you need me again .
he &apos;s a Brit@@ ish c@@ itizen , but he lives in In@@ dia .
you didn &apos;t tell us what he had written in this letter .
Tom passed away three days ago .
Mary put some flowers in the va@@ se .
elephants are an en@@ dang@@ ered species .
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is .
both of my parents are dead .
you seem to know me , but I don &apos;t know you .
I don &apos;t remember saying anything like that .
see , you shouldn &apos;t work so hard .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
find yourselves a seat .
the price is kind of high for a used car .
we &apos;ve been living here since Jan@@ u@@ ary .

does Tom know what you do ?
it &apos;s one for@@ ty @-@ five .
J@@ im likes the doctor .

at first they rejected the pro@@ pos@@ al , but a cl@@ er@@ gy@@ man ur@@ ged them to accept .

you &apos;d better watch what you say .

Tom and Mary have suff@@ ered a lot .
the garden was filled with flowers .
Mary went to the t@@ an@@ ning sal@@ on .
I didn &apos;t see what was in the box .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s in charge of the business .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
Tom never drives above the speed limit .
my brother is now in Australia .
where &apos;s the din@@ ing room ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is a l@@ os@@ er .

I think Tom is awake .
it would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had been here .
you should &apos;ve never come here .

even if they have a good wine menu , I will not want to d@@ ine here .
I &apos;ll try , but I don &apos;t know for sure whether I &apos;ll be able to go to the cin@@ em@@ a tomorrow or not .

Bob helped me .
Tom and Mary told John that they were bored .
Tom and Mary both prefer watching co@@ medi@@ es .

I don &apos;t know why you listen to her .
Tom laid down the gun .
she recently came out as a les@@ bi@@ an .
do you want to go somewhere ? Tom &apos;s coming , too .
it &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .

he has a nice income .
Tom is allergi@@ c to da@@ ir@@ y produc@@ ts .

is there a br@@ ook anywhere near G@@ re@@ en G@@ ables ?
I can &apos;t write in Ar@@ ab@@ ic . I don &apos;t have an Ar@@ ab@@ ic k@@ ey@@ board .

I bet you know this .
we don &apos;t mean any dis@@ respect .

life being very short , you ought not to wast@@ e your time .
do you understand that ?
I want it to be a surpri@@ se .

I want fre@@ e@@ dom .
I am ashamed of myself for my poor English .
Tom didn &apos;t notice me .
all of the toys are woo@@ den .
Mary is a fine @-@ looking woman .
why are you looking at me like that ?
he has no wife , no children and no friends .
I &apos;d rather walk than wait for a bus .
you will have to apologize when you see him .
it is quite natural for her to get angry .
Tom is a few inches sh@@ or@@ ter than Mary .
he ran across the street , leaving her alone .
Mary just got her hair done .
V@@ ol@@ can@@ oes can be active , d@@ or@@ m@@ ant , or ext@@ inct .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
the student coun@@ cil discussed plans for the gradu@@ ation .

Tom took the s@@ cis@@ sors away from Mary .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
she bought chicken .
we slept in a very small t@@ ent .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
everything he says is correct .
he could not re@@ si@@ st the temp@@ tation .
why didn &apos;t you come earlier ?
generally speaking , Japanese women are mode@@ st .
you need to be pretty fit to run up six f@@ lights of stairs .

as soon as I can get a decent video camera , I &apos;ll start making vide@@ o@@ s to put online .
Mary doesn &apos;t like par@@ sle@@ y .
these facts admit of no contra@@ dic@@ tion .
you can think of the rest yourself .
first , let &apos;s talk about what Tom did .
why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
a large crowd had ga@@ thered on the street .
Mary could tell by the way Tom slammed the door that he wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom now wears a wi@@ g .
she sings in the cho@@ ir .
So@@ me@@ how , Tom knew .
is Kim J@@ ong ill or is Kim J@@ ong okay ?
my office is in my apartment .
there &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
I think Tom can help .
he asked for some money .

in the old days , things were a lot simpl@@ er .
do you know how to use this machine ?
Tom sat qui@@ e@@ tly staring at the fire .
give me something to write with .
the comm@@ it@@ te@@ e is made up of ten me@@ mb@@ ers .
the world began without man and it shall end without him .
I have made my decision .
good afternoon .
she met him for breakfast .
that would take too long .
everybody was ga@@ thered in the living room .
what &apos;re you going to do about these cock@@ roa@@ ches ?
it &apos;s not complicated .
did you just meet her ?
most people think so .
sit down on the ben@@ ch .
this large sofa would be out of place in a small room .
tell me more .
year 201@@ 1 &apos;s most no@@ tor@@ i@@ ous expression is &quot; K@@ eba@@ b mur@@ ders . &quot;
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing before he goes home .
everyone thinks the same thing .
the more time I spend doing this , the less time I have to do things I enjoy doing .
Tom had to live with the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces of his ac@@ tions .
wait until tomorrow morning .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re tired already .

I think it is mor@@ ally wrong to eat people .
I promise to call .
do you like por@@ k lo@@ in ?
we have to use the stairs because the elevator is out of order .
you &apos;re never satisfied .
Tom and I had a long conversation while we were waiting for Mary .
I don &apos;t want Tom to hear about this .
I didn &apos;t even get an inv@@ itation .
thus I have heard .
a soci@@ e@@ ty without religion is like a ship without a comp@@ ass .
Tom is b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
how much in@@ toler@@ ance are we prepared to toler@@ ate ?
I wish I &apos;d had more time to pre@@ p@@ are .
don &apos;t make promises you can &apos;t keep .
the house where we spent our first days is un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able . it is the best and most loved one . that is where my youngest sister learned to walk in D@@ ecember . even the sm@@ al@@ lest cor@@ ners of every room e@@ vo@@ ke sweet memories .
the house@@ boat is in the bo@@ ath@@ ouse .

Pa@@ ul@@ a was called away on urgent business .
you must on no account do such a thing .
she speaks H@@ eb@@ re@@ w with her mother and Po@@ lish with her father .
are you being bitten by mosquitoes ?
Tom and I &apos;ve been friends for years .

long live the E@@ m@@ peror !
keeping a horse is a big responsibility .
she was eating a sandwich .
Tom is sli@@ gh@@ tly under the weather today .
I have nothing to tell you at this moment .
Neptune has winds in its at@@ mosphere which b@@ low at over 20@@ 00 kilo@@ meters per hour !
Tom hardly ever ac@@ ts his age .
what is it that you want me to do now ?
when he saw that there was nothing more to see , he took his bike and ro@@ de home .
how is this possible ?
Mary gave Tom all the money she had on her .
she lives with her parents .
the chem@@ ical sym@@ bo@@ l H expres@@ ses hy@@ dro@@ gen .
does this sentence make sense ?
boys have no respect for girls .
your plan seems excellent .
I susp@@ ect that Tom doesn &apos;t do his homework by himself .
what country are you from ?
we have to be careful who we show these plans to .
the people knew he did not like them .
sleep as long as you want .
the clothes horse is always in the way !
the rain today mat@@ ches my mood well .
I can &apos;t keep pa@@ ce with you .
he used to ha@@ unt those ca@@ ves as a little boy .
he &apos;s not thirsty .
I have a han@@ go@@ ver .
Tom should be here after lunch .
I have broken off our eng@@ ag@@ ement .
the beach was crowded with touri@@ sts .
E@@ r@@ r ...

Tom sat on a ben@@ ch reading a book .
where is the P@@ al@@ ace of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts ?
please leave my things as they are .
I didn &apos;t compl@@ ain about anything .
the h@@ all@@ mark of a soci@@ op@@ ath is a lack of em@@ pa@@ thy .
thanks to you .
Tom suggested that we go swimming .
everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country , direc@@ tly or through fre@@ ely chosen repre@@ sent@@ ati@@ ves .
Tom has a violent tem@@ per .
these apples are for Tom .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
does he have gray hair ?
don &apos;t worry . this won &apos;t happen again .
I remember seeing the movie before .
you look sad . what &apos;s wrong ?
forget your trou@@ bl@@ es for a while and come and have dinner with us .
she is a stranger to me .
you don &apos;t seem to have any problem communic@@ ating in French .

would you mind sen@@ ding this letter for me ?
will you look after my children for me ?
Tom has a dog .
it looks like you &apos;ve got a green thumb .
I was sick .
Tom says he did not mean to kill her .
I sent it yesterday ; you should receive it tomorrow .
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
I count on your help .
please don &apos;t be angry !
Mr. T@@ ak@@ a@@ ha@@ shi gave us some homework .
the cha@@ irs are made of a sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic material .
let &apos;s get drunk .
I saw a huge dog lying in front of Mr H@@ ill &apos;s house .
it seemed never @-@ ending .
that &apos;s dangerous !
we understand why .
there is nothing as important as friendship .
may I leave my phone number ?
who gave you that ?
I don &apos;t expect anything from Tom .
I &apos;ll introdu@@ ce you my brother .
those books were on display in the window .
the decision is ours to make .
he had breakfast all alone .
you &apos;re un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
take your time . it &apos;s a mar@@ ath@@ on , not a sp@@ rin@@ t .
I can neither con@@ firm nor den@@ y this .
it &apos;s a mirac@@ le that he wasn &apos;t killed in the accident .
you can still change your mind .
Tom thinks Mary isn &apos;t here .
you should tell your mother as soon as possible .
the stre@@ ets are alive with shop@@ p@@ ers .
Tom is going to do that again .
it &apos;s not like it used to be .
you &apos;d better not stay up too late .
it &apos;s possible Tom and Mary are related .
he &apos;s such a wi@@ mp .
they saw it as the bra@@ ve act of a strong man .
Tom says he has no vices .
we remember .
I &apos;m waiting for a reply .
they told jokes about some of his movies .
I can v@@ ou@@ ch for Tom &apos;s work . he is really good at what he does .
you should look that word up .
can &apos;t you leave me alone ?
put the car into the garage .

I met an American girl .
Mary &apos;s the la@@ z@@ i@@ est of her sch@@ oo@@ l@@ mates .
I like to listen to clas@@ sical music while I work .
close the window .
how on earth could Tom have known that ?
I don &apos;t need your help .
I agree with you .
I &apos;d never let you kiss me .
I &apos;ve already memor@@ ized your phone number .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
he held his breath .
what &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Ar@@ men@@ ia jo@@ ined the W@@ orld T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gani@@ zation in 20@@ 0@@ 3 .
my da@@ ug@@ ther wants a kit@@ ten .
thank you all the same .
I cannot cross this river . it &apos;s too wide .
the auth@@ or doesn &apos;t display much talent in his book .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be deli@@ gh@@ ted to see you .
when was the last time you washed the car ?
I went there .
he likes to talk about himself .
I saw the house .
all work has been carried out by exper@@ ts .
he bo@@ wed to me as he passed by .
I &apos;ll take care of that myself .
there is no point in giving him advice .
he is my brother , not my father .
they are the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor .
Al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly every language is lear@@ n@@ able .
the car is e@@ qui@@ pped with dig@@ it@@ ally contro@@ lled air con@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ ing .
he is on the point of death .
all countries have their emb@@ as@@ si@@ es in the capital .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .

this ugly yellow reminds me of the col@@ or of your bed@@ shee@@ ts .
he climbed M@@ t . F@@ u@@ j@@ i .
the motor@@ c@@ ycle I borrowed from him broke down .
do you see that cute guy over there ?
are there any l@@ and@@ marks ?
Tom owns a thirteen @-@ ac@@ re farm .
Tom thought Mary was asleep .
no one will believe you .
why do we always have to go to Boston , Tom ? there are other beautiful c@@ ities !
I can &apos;t even speak English very well , much less Spanish .
tell Tom I &apos;m looking forward to meeting him .
I need a bi@@ g@@ ger chair .
earth has moun@@ tains , forests , fields , animals and people .
I &apos;m running out of ideas .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
she has enough w@@ ill@@ power .
his argu@@ ment was bas@@ ed on facts .
I don &apos;t want to be a fif@@ th wh@@ eel .
how many friends do you have on F@@ ac@@ ebook ?
Oh , the stre@@ et@@ lights have turned on .
Tatoeba is a dictionary .
we &apos;ve known each other for more than thirty years .
I &apos;m cold . may I close the window ?
she is an@@ xious about your health .
Tom loved sports .
your idea sounds like a good one .
have you ever gone bow@@ ling with Tom ?
it wouldn &apos;t do any good to compl@@ ain about it now .
Tom looked like he was ready to ju@@ mp out a window .
Mary knew that Tom had over@@ heard John and her talking about him .
M@@ at@@ the@@ w drea@@ ded all women except Mar@@ ill@@ a and M@@ rs. R@@ ach@@ el ; he had an un@@ comfortable feeling that the myst@@ eri@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res were secre@@ tly laughing at him .
what is it that bo@@ thers you ?
Tom was finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
Tom foo@@ led all of us .
I want to wash myself .
Tom is still in Boston .
I &apos;m tired of being retired .
he gave me his word .
it happens all the time .
Tom looks great , doesn &apos;t he ?
do you want your money in co@@ ins ?
he was put up for ado@@ p@@ tion .
my e @-@ mail address has been changed .
the river flo@@ ws into the sea .
have you seen the new house that Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n lives in ?
two coffe@@ es , please .
I want to be with my family .
I prepared a weak sugar solution .
Tom climbed up the ro@@ pe .
I don &apos;t know three languages .
I can &apos;t speak French .
be careful ! the knife is very sharp .
I didn &apos;t dream last night .
he is dreaming of be@@ coming an astronau@@ t .
whenever I see him he reminds me of my late grandfather .
what if she doesn &apos;t like me ?
I &apos;m sel@@ fish .
could you do that ?
may I interrupt you ?
could you put these in a box ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
my parents pu@@ shed me to quit the baseball club .
I hate driving .
did you enjoy the salad ?
if that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
I have no desire to do that .
he climbed the stairs .
Tom han@@ ded Mary the letter op@@ en@@ er .
I think it &apos;s OK .
are you still at home ?
I don &apos;t drink beer .
I plan to go to France next year .
you &apos;ll like this .
I &apos;ll pick you up at noon .
you don &apos;t want this , do you ?
Tom never seems to want to sleep .
she was genu@@ in@@ ely worried about him .
why did you steal your grandmother &apos;s je@@ wel@@ ry ?
Tom is still over@@ weight .
have you really talked to Tom ?
I went to the station .
Tom ga@@ ined weight .
the supermarket didn &apos;t have what I wanted .
I &apos;ll never see her again .
all you have to do is sign this paper .
you understand more than me about this sort of thing .
I cannot tell you how disgu@@ sted I felt with myself when I reali@@ zed what I was doing .
Tom is upstairs p@@ acking .
Tom &apos;s conscious .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
it is not what you read but how you read it that counts .
it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen you smile .
after it ra@@ ins and the ground is da@@ mp , it &apos;s ea@@ sier to pu@@ ll wee@@ ds .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
is his father alive ?
he received quite a few letters this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what happened that night .
ask Mary if she has enough money to buy what she needs .
I didn &apos;t know the truth until yesterday .
Pro@@ duc@@ tiv@@ ity is the emplo@@ ye@@ e &apos;s most important char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic .
she was home@@ sick .
I don &apos;t particu@@ larly want to do that .
you want to do that work .
when you have something to say , count to ten before saying it .
I bought a sandwich .
I ate .
Tom can &apos;t re@@ tire .
how was your hon@@ ey@@ moon ?
there are many earthqua@@ kes in Japan .
I &apos;ve seen the way she looks at you .
Tom invited Mary to join him and his family for dinner .
he &apos;s Tom &apos;s cha@@ u@@ ffe@@ ur .
I &apos;m alone now .
it wasn &apos;t that hard .
I &apos;ve never told anyone before .
it &apos;s certain that Geor@@ ge will come .
it probably would be cheaper somewhere else .
Mary and Alice both used to be Tom &apos;s girl@@ friends .
I meant to look it up .
I do not have much time .
I think I &apos;m a pretty good writer .
he won &apos;t turn up tonight .
the leaves have be@@ gun to change col@@ ors .
the effect was immedi@@ ate .
the work must be compl@@ eted by tomorrow .
he &apos;s on his way .
let Tom do this .
Tom is a fire eater .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
a well @-@ made cup of coffee should requ@@ ire no cream or sugar .
Jane kept silent for a long time .
that &apos;s a photo of my sister .
I broke a s@@ w@@ eat running on the t@@ rea@@ d@@ m@@ ill .
please phone him .
now would be a good time .
Tom already did that .
she learned English with great ea@@ ger@@ ness .
we must pun@@ ish him sever@@ ely .
I &apos;ll call the police .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
the joke l@@ oses everything when the jo@@ ker laugh@@ s himself .
Tom came to help .
I haven &apos;t read the report .
will the police come ?
my brother s@@ ends you his warm regar@@ ds .
who should I vote for ?
didn &apos;t I tell you to close the door ?
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to be so friendly .
Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom .
I major@@ ed in chem@@ ist@@ ry when I was in college .
Europe has more cul@@ ture !
O@@ p@@ position to the emb@@ ar@@ go was growing .
I don &apos;t think Tom tried hard enough .
Tom read a lot .
three years is a long time , I feel .
the results were ama@@ zing .
Tom said it wasn &apos;t necessary .
don &apos;t forget that it &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday tomorrow .
I ch@@ all@@ enge you to a fight .
who is your favorite com@@ poser ?
the U.S. president &apos;s pas@@ sport is black , not blue like an a@@ ver@@ age c@@ itizen &apos;s .
maybe she knows the answer .
they told me I had to help you .
whose books are these ?
Tom and Mary only speak French to their children .
I do want to do the si@@ ghts of Kyoto .
that is in my re@@ colle@@ c@@ tions .
have you learned to drive a car ?
I don &apos;t know why you listen to him .
I am sorry to hear that .
J@@ es@@ us hates you .
a g@@ al@@ a@@ xy con@@ tains not only stars , but clouds of gas and dust .
Tom said that he thought that he might be allowed to do that again .
it &apos;s a shame you don &apos;t speak F@@ in@@ n@@ ish .
Tom has done something stupid .
there was no ir@@ rit@@ ation on his part .
the accused thief is on trial now .
China is a major economi@@ c power , with one of the fast@@ est growing economi@@ es in the world .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone in the room .
is it open round the clock ?
you &apos;ll have the report on your desk first thing in the morning .
Tom and Mary cl@@ in@@ ked their glasses together .
keeping the suit on , D@@ im@@ a walked out of the chang@@ ing room and st@@ ated that he wanted to make the purcha@@ se .
Tom doesn &apos;t like hot food .
we were reading a book and it was a very good one .
we both fell asleep .
&quot; would you mind op@@ ening the window ? &quot; &quot; of course not . &quot;
last S@@ at@@ urday , my family went to the zoo to see the p@@ and@@ as .
the pas@@ sword is &quot; M@@ u@@ i@@ ri@@ el . &quot;
those prisoners were set free yesterday .
what &apos;s that very tall building ?
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
you are expected to dress well for this shop .
Tom and Mary discussed their future plans together .
I &apos;m fed up with your con@@ stant compla@@ ining .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was excited .
he has already had lunch .
why don &apos;t you have one ?
I decided to tell him that I love her .
I have to know why .
Tom became angry .
did you recognize your old clas@@ sm@@ ate ?
I &apos;m of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher .
I like to play the piano .
this is quite difficult for Tom .
they aren &apos;t related .
what was done to you doesn &apos;t excuse what you did .
the children are already tired .
do you drink alco@@ ho@@ l ?
after three drinks , the man passed out .
please open the door .
Tom probably wants to eat some Chinese food .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go anywhere else .
what have you come here for ?
the au@@ to indu@@ st@@ ry is hi@@ ring again .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
I cannot fix the computer .
I really liked the movie .
having discussed the new project for three hours , we con@@ clu@@ ded that An@@ drew &apos;s plan was the best .
I miss my children .
I can &apos;t stand her jeal@@ ou@@ sy .
this will requ@@ ire a huge invest@@ ment of time and money .
it was very difficult to convin@@ ce Tom .
you &apos;re the love of my life , and you will be forever .
I should move to Boston .
the game ended at nine o &apos;clock .
the gor@@ ill@@ a was one year old at the time .
what part of Canada are you from ?
how much is this tie ?
I sent you a new e @-@ mail .

Tom cut down all the trees in his front y@@ ard .
basketball is very fun to play .
I can &apos;t stay much longer .

I would often take a walk before breakfast .
the children went to school in spite of the rain .

Dr. K@@ le@@ in recommended you to me .
this book is full of er@@ r@@ ors .
what is he talking about ? it just doesn &apos;t make sense .
of course it &apos;s a good thing when someone learning a foreign language tries to use it without fear of making mistakes , but I don &apos;t think much of people without sufficient abi@@ lity produc@@ ing language learning material of poor quality .
do you think he will really give up ?
she talked to the chair@@ person .
hello , girls .
Tom is sitting on the grass .
bring me the newspaper .

call me when you get there .
I know him quite well .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
you should wear a coat .
we &apos;re like a big family here .
as a result of always being hungry and f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , that dog finally died .
Tom was famous .
there is no escape from fate .
he does not know .
it could happen to you , too .
do you notice anything different about Tom ?
people often take me for my brother .
I already feel much better .

I kind of lost my fo@@ c@@ us .
I simply don &apos;t know what to say ...
I must get it fi@@ xed .
this book is far above me .
since I was little I have loved going to the sea with my family .
do you think you &apos;re o@@ be@@ se ?

I cannot do the work on my own .
sometimes I wish I had a twin brother . that &apos;d be fun .
such a tri@@ vi@@ al thing is out of the question .
I sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours .
Mary immediately recogni@@ zed his voice . it was Tom !

these ty@@ pes of books have almost no val@@ ue .
there &apos;s still a lot to do .
should Scot@@ land be an independent country ?
Tom will be free tomorrow .

get out of bed !
I go to school on foot .

Liisa and Mar@@ k@@ k@@ u are enti@@ rely different in temper@@ a@@ ment and constantly at six@@ es and se@@ vens .
he studies the B@@ ible .
you can see the S@@ k@@ y@@ tree from there .
it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not very optimi@@ stic .
Tom called Mary a trait@@ or .

an American G@@ over@@ nment cannot per@@ mit Americans to star@@ ve .
last year in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines , earthqua@@ kes and ti@@ d@@ al waves resul@@ ted in the dea@@ ths of more than 6@@ ,000 people .

we &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
this road is too n@@ ar@@ row for cars to pass .
the shirt is very dirty . before you go to school , it has to be washed .
I believe that stri@@ c@@ ter vi@@ g@@ il@@ ance is necessary here .
o that I had so much power !
you ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
kiss Tom for me .
I want to know why you lied to me .
I &apos;m not really very thirsty .
I can only tell you what I know .
I &apos;m good at tennis .
do you like it then ?
please be quiet .
how clever !
try it once again .
he came late , as is often the case with him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .

the old man lost his will to live .

do you know what they want ?
Tom suff@@ ered from a heart attack and almost died waiting for the am@@ bul@@ ance .
I like to watch TV .
I can &apos;t spend the rest of my life living with Tom .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
it &apos;ll rain soon .
come home .
where does Tom have to do that ?
I &apos;m still un@@ decided .
I bought two cotton shir@@ ts .
don &apos;t han@@ g up , but hold on please .
she is singing the latest popular songs .
in gener@@ al , men are taller than women .
how long have you two been eng@@ aged ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to lose some weight .
a decision will be even more difficult the longer you d@@ el@@ ay it .
I think Tom is smarter than Mary .
I always con@@ fuse which side is port and which star@@ board .
this bookstore stopped selling J@@ U@@ M@@ P .
I &apos;m afraid not .
whatever she told you , it &apos;s not true .
Tom has finished un@@ p@@ acking his suitcase .
Tom used to help his father in the store after school .
he made up his mind to write in his diary every day .
she began to cry .
however cold it may be , he still jo@@ gs 20 kilo@@ meters every day .
Tom was still a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or then .
that &apos;s my favorite shirt , and I always wash it by hand .
I wish I could help you .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was depen@@ d@@ able .

he was at home .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn to help wash the dishes .

only a third of the students came to class today .
suddenly , something u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected happened .
and then everyone started laughing .
do you believe in ang@@ els ?
I can do it without you .
you are hearing things .
Tom saw a girl sitting all alone , so he went over to talk to her .
I asked Tom if he was nervous .
when do you want to meet Tom ?
I barely had time to finish this report before the meeting .
I went to N@@ ag@@ as@@ ak@@ i .
Tom &apos;s had a lot of girl@@ friends .
Tom never compla@@ ins .

I could spend hours in here .

Tom has been in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated since 201@@ 3 .
you &apos;re absolutely right !
this story does not make sense !
my feet are killing me .
do you have a map of Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
I thought you might be curi@@ ous .
that evening I left my tip under a coffee cup , which I left up@@ side down on the table .
I &apos;d rather die than do what you &apos;re asking me to do .
this is the tri@@ cky part .
I don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck about what you think .
some boys came into the classroom .
a dog is a loyal animal .
Mary is mad at me because she thinks I stole her boyfriend .
I left the window open .
so far as I can remember , there is not one word in the G@@ osp@@ els in p@@ raise of intelligence .
be cont@@ ent with your lot ; one cannot be first in everything .
which is cheaper , the bus or the street car ?
been there , done that .
when was the last time you slept in this room ?
the quarrel had un@@ fortun@@ ate con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces .
what will I forget to write ?
did you already do your homework ?
Tom seems to be de@@ pres@@ sed .
above all , fa@@ me means dying at the right time .
my mother sp@@ ends a lot of money on clothes .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bu@@ sh .
then , the train scre@@ e@@ ched to a hal@@ t .

who wrote these letters ?
I study French , too .
it &apos;s open .
the person on the left ru@@ ins the bal@@ ance of the picture .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
I wish you weren &apos;t always so busy .
Tom looked very young .
he is R@@ a@@ mu@@ d@@ u .
the rain hasn &apos;t stopped yet , has it ?
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
it was a new experience for her .
where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s hope .
Tom died three days after he arrived in Boston .
don &apos;t you have to go to school today ?

Tom has some advice for us .
E@@ ston@@ ia has its own n@@ ati@@ onal an@@ them .
he de@@ c@@ ei@@ ves others with his app@@ ear@@ ance .

now it &apos;s your turn .
I believe in the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
Tom is in police custo@@ dy now .
I would like to have a look at your colle@@ ction of sta@@ m@@ ps .
none of us saw Tom and Mary do that .
were you able to make it to the station on time to catch the first train this morning ?
she &apos;s honest enough , but can you really trust her ?
he drank the whis@@ ky as if it were water .
Tom raised his glass and said , &quot; T@@ o the happy couple ! &quot;
how come you &apos;re so crazy ?
thanks , M@@ om .

anybody is better than nobody .
OK , I &apos;ll order it .

Tom wasn &apos;t able to change Mary &apos;s mind .
the day is short and there &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom got here on time .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of movie .
where do I get off ?
G@@ or@@ ill@@ as cannot use their lips and ton@@ gu@@ es to speak , but they can communic@@ ate with people in other ways .
do you think French is difficult ?
how d@@ are you talk about Tom like that !
Unfortunately , an er@@ ror has occurred .

I &apos;m sure that was her .
well , then , if you want me to I &apos;ll do it .
he &apos;s a l@@ and@@ lu@@ b@@ ber .
she &apos;s wearing sunglasses .
Tom told me not to open that door .
you were correct .
she explained the reason why she was late .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was innocent .
she &apos;s only two years old , but she can already count to 1@@ 00 .
what do you want them to do ?
please keep this money for me .

I will noti@@ fy Tom .
the im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts dream of having a new , better life .

would you like to go for a walk ?
I want to know more about Tom &apos;s bi@@ ological parents .

talking to Tom is like talking to a bri@@ ck wall .
Tom has rejected our offer .
where are you going this afternoon ?
yesterday was the first day of au@@ tum@@ n .
I got here as fast as I could .
everything you have will have you someday .
nobody loves me .
even at that early age the other children could probably tell there was something wrong , de@@ spite the fact that I never susp@@ ected anything of the sort ; and this was to be the case for a long time to come .
B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing is chang@@ ing so r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly .
we discussed what to do .
Tom was afraid that Mary would say no .
Unfortunately , it rained yesterday .

the machine again made the usual noise and prin@@ ted out the following an@@ aly@@ sis .
she was a z@@ eal@@ ous wor@@ ker for char@@ ity .
my dress doesn &apos;t fit anymore !
why are you so nice to everyone ?

it was a very good experience for him .
Tom got bored after fifteen minutes .
I doubt if this shop will ever pay its way .
no human power can manage that .

Tom ho@@ ped the rain would stop before he had to walk home .

she is a good deal older than he .
you &apos;re spending too much time worrying .
do you really think money will bring you happiness ?

she was really satisfied .
don &apos;t mind if I do !

she looked out of the window .

I think it &apos;s better you stay here until the snow stop@@ s .
I don &apos;t have a son named Tom .
OK , I understand .
he is a very la@@ zy boy .

I gave Tom no choice .
what &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
I &apos;ve always fed my dogs in the early evening .
in the next four years , 15 billion e@@ uro@@ s must be saved .
birds usually wake up early in the morning .
I don &apos;t mind in the sli@@ gh@@ test who he is .

it &apos;s good if you can sing .
Tom travel@@ s a lot .
Tom saw a ho@@ mel@@ ess man s@@ ca@@ ven@@ ging through a rub@@ b@@ ish b@@ in looking for food .
give peace a chance .
Tom won &apos;t likely feel like doing that .
take that box away !
Tom died from a drug over@@ d@@ ose .
there are many low @-@ cost air@@ l@@ ines in Europe .
was it really that bad ?
I only have 2@@ 4 hours left to decide .
I do all the work .
there was scar@@ c@@ ely any money left .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so angry .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
who owns the In@@ ter@@ net ?
the Col@@ os@@ seum is one of Ital@@ y &apos;s top tourist attrac@@ tions .
I wish I &apos;d planted more le@@ tt@@ u@@ ce this year .
Tom was cour@@ te@@ ous .
on October 20 , Tom died and was re@@ placed by an i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal cl@@ one .

I got up very early this morning .
she may have been right .
Tom was bi@@ as@@ ed .
please stick this la@@ be@@ l to your bag@@ g@@ age .
Tom walked ahead .
this is for you .
your ang@@ er is completely justi@@ fied .
taking moder@@ ate exer@@ ci@@ se will do you good .
I have no friends to help me .
it is foolish of you to believe such a thing .
how well can you sk@@ ate ?
don &apos;t tell cru@@ de jokes in the pres@@ ence of my father .
my sister ou@@ ted me to my parents !
tell me how to sp@@ ell the word .
I am very con@@ serv@@ ative .
you could get arrested for that .
I had ren@@ ted it the day before .
though Al@@ fr@@ ed is scru@@ pul@@ ous in ful@@ fil@@ ling his du@@ ties at work , he is less con@@ scienti@@ ous about his oblig@@ ations at home .
we don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
you must apologize to her , and do it at once .
we flew across the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic .
his mobile has been stolen .
I would like to talk to you the day after tomorrow .
stay here until I get back .

I like the old car more than the new .

what do you feed your dog ?
do you have a friend that can help you ?
the train was d@@ el@@ a@@ yed on account of snow .
I hear you did something stupid .

she has a husband and two daughters .
Tom pro@@ posed to me .
I bet the teacher &apos;s going to get mad !
Tom told me he &apos;ll join us later .
Tom &apos;s eyesight isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
young people like his books .
I grew up in a small town .
do you really think that could happen ?
Mr W@@ il@@ der gave me your e @-@ mail address .
please c@@ ir@@ cle the right answer .
isn &apos;t that your dictionary ?
could you please put that somewhere else ?
they talked about love .
Tom died with a knife in his back .
she ought to have arrived by now .
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
before winter I &apos;ll have the windows painted , as the paint on them is slowly pe@@ el@@ ing off , e@@ speci@@ ally outside .
the baby can stand but can &apos;t walk .
Tom told me that you like to eat sp@@ ic@@ y food .
Tom called to say that he &apos;d be late .
I thought it was a joke .
can any of us speak Spanish ?
do you have a menu in English ?
the eng@@ ine is pur@@ ring .
what do you have in your bag ?
isn &apos;t it enough for you ?
she is always compla@@ ining of her husband &apos;s small sal@@ ary .
do you want to know his name ?
I en@@ vy him .
I also want to try .
Tom cla@@ ims he doesn &apos;t watch much TV , but he watch@@ es more than three hours every day .
he talked to the chair@@ man .
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone .
I &apos;m sure that Mary can take care of herself .
where does Tom live ?
someone left you a message .
how many people ?
just a moment .
she received the electricity bill today .
the ex@@ port business isn &apos;t doing well .
shall we stop soon ?
I know Tom is old .
who hel@@ ps her ?
W@@ ra@@ p the d@@ ough in clear film and ch@@ ill for 15 to 30 minutes .
you won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
a cat is lying on the sofa .
it made me a little sad .
Tom can &apos;t get along with Mary .
seriously , don &apos;t be a stranger .
Tom has been extremely coo@@ per@@ ative .
he has a sp@@ i@@ der fe@@ ti@@ sh .
I suggest you stay out of my way .
my travel fe@@ es to Japan are paid for by the university .
are you sure that you want to do this ?
Mary lost her favorite pen .
this stea@@ k is too t@@ ough .
Dr. H@@ ide@@ o N@@ o@@ gu@@ ch@@ i died in Afri@@ ca in 19@@ 2@@ 8 .
I will raise my children so that they will be prot@@ ected from super@@ st@@ ition .
every day I go to the ca@@ f@@ é and have coffee .
I invited him over to my place .
bug off !
she looked at me like I was crazy .
you are the last person whom I expected to meet here .
I have a message for Tom .
I stro@@ lled along the stre@@ ets to kill time .
is it true that you argu@@ ed with T@@ an@@ in@@ n@@ a ?
B@@ e@@ lie@@ f is the death of intelligence .
life is for living .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s father .
even the most beautiful rose will someday w@@ il@@ t .
he is not coming , either .
Tom finally got his wish .
are you coming to the store with me ?
I am coun@@ ting in German .
you &apos;ve got your whole life ahead of you .
Tom asked me who was responsible for the accident .
I inter@@ pre@@ ted what he said in French into Japanese .
Tom is fairly preten@@ ti@@ ous .
he comes to see me nearly every day .
Tom is full of life .
do you have a viol@@ in ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
it rais@@ es a red flag for busin@@ es@@ sm@@ en .
six times three equ@@ als eighteen .
N@@ et @-@ pro@@ fit comes to 10 million dollars every year .
the light is off .
I didn &apos;t expect thanks anyway .
she mi@@ st@@ ook me for my brother .
Japan im@@ por@@ ts various ra@@ w materi@@ als from abroad .
I don &apos;t know either twin .
you won &apos;t have that problem .
they &apos;re self @-@ sufficient .
my girlfriend still doesn &apos;t know my parents .
his knowledge of ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y is in@@ sufficient .
that has nothing to do with you .
I wanted to talk to you about what happened .
Tom po@@ ked the fire with a stick .
there was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters .
she swal@@ lowed her pride .
you have made him what he is .
this is a story written in easy English .
you ought to find nice shoes here .
it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s clear@@ ing up .
do both Tom and Mary sn@@ ore ?
quality , not quantity .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ itate to ask .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was impolite .
Tom laughed at the misunder@@ standing .
Tom spent three years in Australia .
I can &apos;t give you these .
we were all tired .
it looks like Tom only wears expensive clothes .
that &apos;s probably the best idea to begin with .
nobody answered my question .
how many p@@ and@@ as are there in this zoo ?
were you in America last month ?
I used to be a drug ad@@ dict .
if you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
do you have any ice ton@@ gs ?
Tom sent Mary a picture of his new kit@@ ten .
what &apos;ll Tom win ?
Tom lacks imag@@ in@@ ation .
I &apos;m only here by mistake .
I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
your offer is a life @-@ sa@@ ver .
Tom looks a little annoyed .
is that dog m@@ ale or f@@ em@@ ale ?
Mary &apos;s not pretty , but she isn &apos;t ugly , either .
why is everything so complicated ?
my father is always busy .
S@@ am , don &apos;t !
&quot; Tom knows . &quot; &quot; he does ? did you tell him ? &quot;
I &apos;ll deal with this problem as soon as I can .
why doesn &apos;t Tom have to pay anything ?
I &apos;ve read that book .
she post@@ p@@ oned her trip to M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
this book belongs to Pa@@ ol@@ o .
she has long hair .
you should eat vegetables .
she worked from morning till night .
my uncle , who lives in Paris , came to see us .
do you read something be@@ sides the B@@ ible ?
you &apos;re not planning to stay up all night , are you ?
you are such a crazy driver ; you drive me crazy .
the Japanese like to travel in groups .
I de@@ sp@@ ise my parents .
the prince says that the world will be saved by beauty ! and I main@@ tain that the reason he has such pla@@ y@@ ful ideas is that he is in love .
I don &apos;t understand how the human b@@ rain works .
Tom made Mary very happy .
let &apos;s go home , Tom .
how can I become a trusted us@@ er ?
the stea@@ k is well done .
many comm@@ ent@@ at@@ ors reg@@ ard O@@ ba@@ ma as a cen@@ tri@@ st .
she talked to the chair@@ person .
who built it ?
do you happen to know how to get down@@ town from here ?
Tom put everything back on the shelf .
don &apos;t you think I know my own wife ?
I knew he was waiting for Mary .
I am divorced .
I wish you &apos;d stop doing that .
don &apos;t try to fri@@ gh@@ ten me .
she &apos;s not a good cook .
if I had enough money , I could buy this book .
Tom and Mary went hunting for E@@ a@@ ster eggs .
I am happy to hear your voice .
the Japanese are generally considered to be very indu@@ stri@@ ous .
the mi@@ st pre@@ vented him from seeing very far .
I &apos;ve done that a few times .
the last time that I smel@@ led something similar to this tea was in the gir@@ aff@@ e house at the zoo .
I &apos;ve never been so happy to see potatoes in my life .
is it true that you &apos;ve never played po@@ ker before ?
it &apos;s hard to please him .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
a squ@@ are has four ang@@ les .
I don &apos;t have time to listen to your life story .
she fell in love with her teacher .
his daughter is a nurse .
it &apos;s very cold this winter .
why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom left the room .
she killed time reading a magaz@@ ine while she waited .
have you ever travel@@ led by plane ?
Tom wondered what Mary was so upset about .
I didn &apos;t want to look foolish .
Tom passed the bu@@ tter to Mary .
Tom bought a rose and gave it to Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you the reason why I did that .
you &apos;re really gif@@ ted .
my mother &apos;s religion helped her to come to terms with my father &apos;s death .
stop h@@ itting Tom .
thank you , C@@ ap@@ tain O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous .
I used to keep a diary when I was at high school .
how many different pieces are there in Japanese chess ?
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
should I go to the party ?
Tom brought his dog to school .
is there any problem with fee@@ ding my dog ice cream ?
a foreign language can &apos;t be ma@@ st@@ ered in a year or so .
let me give this to you before I forget .
Tom came at an in@@ opportun@@ e time .
Tom didn &apos;t have a chance .
the statement sounds im@@ prob@@ able .
he lost the watch which he had bought the day before .
my legs are as heavy as lead .
Tom was screaming .
why would Tom lie about something like that ?
Tom and Mary told John they wanted Alice to teach them how to do that .
I &apos;m waiting for a respon@@ se .
I hope I never meet him again .
what do I owe him ?
this program has an in@@ tu@@ itive us@@ er inter@@ face .
it depends on the situation .
waiter , the check , please .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was awake .
where would you go if you could time travel ?
how long do you intend to spend at the library ?
Tom often goes there .
this can@@ di@@ date is signific@@ an@@ tly better com@@ pared to his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
the bird was looking for wor@@ ms .
she pretended to be a student .
my favourite col@@ our is red .
money can &apos;t buy life .
you &apos;re just jealous .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was sleepy .
he has good reason to get very angry .
Tom will try .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
she ac@@ ce@@ ded to our de@@ man@@ ds .
M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement tried to app@@ ease lab@@ or by off@@ ering them a b@@ on@@ us .
I missed the point of the joke .
Tom told me to be kind to others .
by the way , how old are you ?
they walked along the street side by side .
what was I talking about , again ?
Tom is non@@ pl@@ us@@ sed .
you may say that it &apos;s sh@@ it .
everything app@@ ears to be going well .
I &apos;m looking for someone who speaks German .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
I &apos;m not ashamed that I am poor .
Tom has to take medicine every three hours .
a cooki@@ e is under the table .
why &apos;d you do that ?
Mari@@ e had a cat .
give Tom his keys .
the village was silent .
that &apos;s why I told you that you shouldn &apos;t go alone .
I didn &apos;t really like the st@@ ew that Tom made .
not so quickly , children , I &apos;m not so young anymore !
he is not a politici@@ an but a lawyer .
I &apos;ll help you as soon as I &apos;ve done that .
we look forward to your en@@ tries .
he &apos;s unconscious .
leave me alone .
I don &apos;t understand this word . could you par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se it ?
hi , S@@ us@@ an . how are you ?
let &apos;s start with you .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tom only sleep@@ s about five hours a night .
are you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
road traffic in@@ ju@@ ries are a major public health problem and a leading cause of death .
I know you think this is a stupid thing to do , but I plan to do it anyway .
no passengers were injured .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
stop car@@ ping !
the m@@ ere thought of a snake makes me shi@@ ver .
it &apos;s as clear as cr@@ y@@ st@@ al .
Tom didn &apos;t even have the de@@ cen@@ cy to admit it was his fault .
have you mea@@ sured it ?
Tom is a big boy .
you &apos;re Russian ?
Tom and Mary were busy .
she called you .
what else did you see ?
don &apos;t keep bad company .
there &apos;s no rest for the wicked .
please don &apos;t touch the ice with b@@ are hands .
you should tell him the truth .
we think that the n@@ ar@@ row road was responsible for the accident .
you &apos;re going to have to pay in adv@@ ance .
we need more talented people .
her parents are older than ours .
I &apos;m worried for you .
Tom lives near us .
having been left alone , the baby started to cry .
Tom should be here after lunch .
almost three thousand people died .
sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to interrupt you .
the book is new .
Tom has really taught me many things .
Tom and Mary are the only survi@@ v@@ ors .
this is how I did it .
the D@@ i@@ et broke up in con@@ fu@@ sion .
Tom would treat you with respect .
nobody can fore@@ see what &apos;ll happen .
Tom takes after his father .
I already spoke to Tom .
I can &apos;t see the road sig@@ ns in this fo@@ g .
Tom makes a lot more money than I do .
my opinion is a little different from yours .
Tom is interested in French liter@@ ature .
get ready for school .
Tom put his hands on Mary &apos;s shoul@@ ders .
all the passengers were killed in the crash .
what good are those ?
do you prefer cute guys or guys who have class ?
I told W@@ illi@@ am , but he didn &apos;t believe me .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
&quot; objection , your hon@@ or . &quot; &quot; O@@ ver@@ ru@@ led . &quot;
almost everyone I know can speak French .
can I see you in my office for a minute ?
you &apos;re not Cana@@ dian .
they grew angry .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
the first item on Tom &apos;s list of things to take with him on his trip is his mobile phone re@@ char@@ ger .
have you decided whether you are going into town by bike or by bus ?
were both Tom and Mary born in Australia ?
what col@@ or car did you buy ?
I think that you &apos;re wrong .
could you give us a minute ?
Oh , my God !
he did everything for her .
please bring it back tomorrow .
that &apos;s his speci@@ al@@ ty .
Tom ate alone .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
he didn &apos;t exactly co@@ ver himself in gl@@ ory .
Tom wan@@ dered off .
I &apos;ll protect Tom .
this regu@@ l@@ ation will take effect next year .
we bar@@ red the door and locked it .
the little boy grew very fast .
I was bored .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know why Mary had to do that .
rich as he is , he is not happy .
she &apos;s such a swee@@ the@@ art .
your explanation is too ab@@ str@@ act for me .
V@@ ir@@ tu@@ es and girls are most beautiful before kno@@ wing that they are beautiful .
he slammed the door right in my face .
we will have a math qui@@ z tomorrow .
I have a bicycle .
I don &apos;t feel comfortable here .
Tom doesn &apos;t trust the government .
this is what he said .
the reason I succ@@ eeded was because I was lucky .
she has a k@@ een business sense .
she is listening to him .
obviously I agree that you should adv@@ ance in life through your own eff@@ orts .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
I have a message for you from her .
before going to France , Mr. Su@@ z@@ u@@ k@@ i studied French .
after lunch today , our plan is to take a walk in the park .
take action .
Mike takes after his father in everything .
Tom and Mary wondered if John could be persua@@ ded teach their children French .
the in@@ iti@@ al sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms of the dis@@ ease are fever and sore throat .
a cold rain fell over the city .
when should I pick you up tomorrow ?
So@@ ci@@ al@@ is@@ m never took roo@@ t in America because the poor see themselves not as an explo@@ ited pro@@ let@@ ari@@ at , but as tem@@ por@@ ar@@ ily embarr@@ as@@ sed million@@ ai@@ res .
she wore her hair in pla@@ its .
my cousin is h@@ oo@@ ked on sm@@ ack .
Tom lives in a row house .
there are a couple of par@@ ks not too far from my house .
what else is there to say ?
he probably won &apos;t come .
she &apos;s afraid of getting sick again .
education is the best an@@ ti@@ do@@ te against violence .
we have to avoid the nuclear war by all means .
Tom said something to Mary .
you had better not stay up late .
you had plenty of time .
how much do I owe you for the ticket ?
cook for me .
do you like them ?
please come visit us more often .
Tom and Mary asked me to help them do that .
Mary hasn &apos;t painted her room yet .
the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition is well worth a visit .
why exactly would you want to do that ?
you &apos;ll find the letter under these p@@ apers .
today is not so cold .
you should go in there .
men &apos;s natural ri@@ ghts are equal ; claim is met by claim , eff@@ ort by eff@@ ort , and force by force .
he &apos;ll fre@@ e@@ ze to death out here .
the fire destroyed three houses .
I don &apos;t want to see her anymore .
I think that Tom is still sleepy .
you &apos;ll have to discuss that with Tom .
the train is coming .
co@@ py this , please .
I thought that working in a Japanese company would im@@ prove my Japanese , but it has only served to show me how far I still have to go .
nobody can do that better than Tom .
she wanted to get away from every@@ day life .
I never inten@@ ded to hurt you .
there &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
she had never seen New York before , so I offered to show her around .
she looked gla@@ mor@@ ous .
I sat down on the cou@@ ch next to Tom .
few students are interested in reading this novel .
the trees are beginning to bu@@ d .
my favorite music is po@@ p music .
as he looked through the store window , D@@ im@@ a &apos;s eyes wi@@ d@@ ened as they fell upon a gor@@ ge@@ ous black suit , and then wi@@ d@@ ened even more when he noticed the 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .@@ 9@@ 9 B@@ Y@@ R price ta@@ g .
Li@@ v@@ est@@ rea@@ ming is popular in China .

Tom divorced Mary .
she was busy doing her homework .
nobody wants to play with Tom .
would you be kind enough to write ?
I rep@@ lied that I didn &apos;t have parents any more .
let &apos;s walk on the beach after dinner .
he can &apos;t sing well .

don &apos;t look down on the poor .
how much time and energy do you spend on pro@@ j@@ ects that don &apos;t make you any money ?
I want to marry Tom .
put me through to the b@@ oss , please .
Tom almost got caught .
Tom had forgotten his umbrella so I lent him one of mine .
Tom thought about this .
social custo@@ ms v@@ ary from country to country .
I &apos;m not sure about that . it depends .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
I spent the whole day in the park .
to make a long story short , we married .
she fell asleep on my shoul@@ der .
look at the flowers in the park .
she was wearing long boo@@ ts .
has something changed ?
Tom and Mary loved each other .
Tom is lucky he has so many friends .
I &apos;m turning the light off .
sugar will dis@@ solve in a glass of water quickly .
Tom always speaks in such a low voice that I can barely understand what he says .
that &apos;s not what I asked you .
you &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
my father came home at nine .
Tom became a whi@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ lower .
Tom sent me there .
there were no more apples in the box .
there &apos;s a monster under my bed .
Tom divorced Mary after the children graduated from college .
this is the most ab@@ sur@@ d thing I have ever heard .
he is at home today .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
it &apos;s too bad that Tom is sick .
try your best in everything .
they are sin@@ gers .
there &apos;s something I need to show you .
I like the Japanese language very much .
Tom is dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing Mary .
he moved out of his parents &apos; place .
have you tried it before ?
what does this have to do with my family ?
he is about for@@ ty .
eighty percent of success is sho@@ wing up .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone .
what would I do without you ?
Tom was lonely .
Tom didn &apos;t understand the question .
there were many who couldn &apos;t recognize him in that disgu@@ ise .
Tom &apos;s c@@ ell@@ phone is ringing .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
I don &apos;t think he can handle the truth .
&quot; why , An@@ ne , how you &apos;ve grown ! &quot; she said , almost un@@ belie@@ v@@ ingly .
I got back in my car .
a smart fal@@ c@@ on hi@@ des its tal@@ ons .

tell Tom you can &apos;t do it .
you cannot see your own face without a mir@@ ror .
Yes , sau@@ sage and sau@@ er@@ k@@ ra@@ ut please .

whenever he ex@@ pla@@ ins something , he can &apos;t stop . he ra@@ mb@@ les on .

if I were you , I would do the same .
the girl was always following her mother .
I was fin@@ ed six thousand yen for a par@@ king viol@@ ation .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you all day .
I met an old man who says that he &apos;s never eaten at a restaurant in his whole life .
I would swim through the ocean just to see your smile again .
Tom said I was already unconscious by the time the par@@ a@@ medic@@ s arrived .
this w@@ rist@@ watch is very valuable .
that is the thing that concer@@ ns you .
this TV was made ten years ago and there are no par@@ ts available , so it is impossible to repair it .
Tom loves being around people .
the cri@@ min@@ al was app@@ re@@ h@@ ended by an off @-@ duty policeman .
I don &apos;t want to write with this pen .
I want to tell you that I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .

she went on working till he called her .
it &apos;s just between you and me , but K@@ az@@ u@@ o &apos;s wife is pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant .

we should drink 6@@ 4 oun@@ ces of flu@@ i@@ ds a day .
don &apos;t make me do this .
bananas are en@@ ergi@@ zing .
I &apos;ve been sick in bed since last Monday .
Tom loves Mary with all his heart .
Tom &apos;s dog attacked Mary .
it must be the post@@ man .
I met your girlfriend .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
are you looking for anything in particular ?
he has three brothers .
Tom heard Mary yel@@ ling .
which do you prefer , tea or coffee ?
Tom expres@@ sed himself clearly .
I asked for a seat in the no @-@ smoking sec@@ tion .
don &apos;t ever talk to me like that again .
after they argu@@ ed , they didn &apos;t speak to each other for a week .
that was only a year ago .
I look forward to reading your report .
it &apos;s v@@ ir@@ tually impossible for Tom to pass the exam .
who else uses it ?
Tom is now middle age and has serious health problems .
who removed it ?
this is a fas@@ cin@@ ating book .
that &apos;s great ! I &apos;ll look at it later .
Tom still calls French fries F@@ reedom fries .
Mary is my girlfriend .
the pink pil@@ low is clean .
Mary will never understand why we want her to do this .

I didn &apos;t know you were coming to visit .
I could make you happy .
you &apos;re bra@@ ver than I am .
I broke that one .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was impolite .
I don &apos;t want to go outside on a day like this .
could you explain it to me ?
Tom often ac@@ ts like a baby when he can &apos;t get his way .
how many pen@@ s do you have ?
I wonder why Tom is crying .
she takes part in many school ac@@ tiv@@ ities .
all animals are equal .
he appro@@ a@@ ched with tre@@ mbling and admir@@ ation , and fell down upon his kne@@ es before her .
men who were ber@@ e@@ ft of reason con@@ duc@@ ted the war .
why are you pretending you don &apos;t remember ?
I saw you yesterday .
Tom is just going to need some time .
L@@ aw@@ yers are all li@@ ar@@ s .
this is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
I wonder who the people I saw her with were .
even I can understand this sentence . it &apos;s very easy to understand .
I expect that Tom will win .
Tom and his bu@@ d@@ dies sli@@ t the thro@@ ats of eleven men and women .
when she smil@@ es , I feel like mel@@ ting .
I quit smoking two years ago .
we were all so scared .

F@@ reedom is a new religion , the religion of our time .
sugar isn &apos;t good for your health .
that &apos;s a promise .
please do something about it .
one third of the earth &apos;s surface is desert .
Tom needs time to think it over .
you keep for@@ getting to pay the bills .
he disappeared again .
Tom is the one who told me how to do it .
he u@@ tters an exc@@ la@@ mation of anno@@ y@@ ance .
Tom just took a chance and called Mary to ask her out .
he &apos;s a gar@@ den@@ er .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
it being clou@@ dy , I took my umbrella with me .
have you ever hu@@ gged your children ?
Tom took the bottle from Mary and poured himself a drink .
Tom is very polite .
who &apos;s the girl in a yellow rain@@ coat ?
did Tom for@@ give you ?
are you hungry ?
we jumped off our bi@@ kes and sat in the grass .
Tom looked up and laughed .
I know who to call when I need help .
